# GAD405 - Assignment 1

Github Link: https://github.com/SnowiiDream/GAD405

My project involves an array of rectangles in the background that move side to side continuously. In the centre I also put two large ellipses which one rotates clockwise whilst the other one rotates counter clockwise. When the viewer clicks onto the screen the rectangles change into small ellipses and also change to a random colour, along with the two large ellipses also changing into the same random colour. If you hold down on the mouse button then the shapes continuously flash random colours until the viewer stops clicking on the mouse. Due to the background being slightly translucent this resulted into the shapes that are moving leave a trail behind them.
